[French Version of the ReadME](https://github.com/Martial4034/Agence-le-Home/blob/main/README.md)

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive redesign I conducted for my parents' website: **Agence Immobilière Le Home**, in collaboration with Alfa-Concept. This project showcases my skills in web project management, UX/UI design, and front-end optimization.

## Project Objectives

- **Modernize Appearance**: Update the design to reflect a modern and professional image of the agency.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Simplify navigation and improve accessibility across all platforms.
- **Optimize Performance**: Reduce loading times and enhance site responsiveness.

## Results

I'm placing the result in the first section because it's obviously what we're most interested in: the before/after comparison. More details about the process are described below. The redesigned site has been successfully launched, offering a modern interface, intuitive navigation, and improved overall performance. The feedback from users and stakeholders has been extremely positive.

## Process and Development

### Initial Analysis

A detailed discussion of needs with myself and my parents allowed us to assess the old site to identify key areas for improvement. It quickly became apparent that the website redesign needed to be accompanied by an update to the agency's brand identity.

### Identity of Agence Le Home

The brand identity update began with modernizing the logo, created over 60 years ago and had become less suited to contemporary requirements of versatility, especially for online use and on various physical media.

**Old logo:**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xz1tySA.png" alt="Old logo of Agence Le Home" style="width: 200px;"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;"><em>Old logo - simple, blue on white</em></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**New logos:**

The redesign introduced several variants of the logo for flexible use in different contexts:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Minimalist white logo</th>
    <th>Minimalist blue logo</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6DRoHan.png" alt="Minimalist white logo" style="width: 200px;"></td>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QTFnlsG.png" alt="Minimalist blue logo" style="width: 200px;"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Logo with name - white background</th>
    <th>Logo with name - blue background</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gY3w0Lx.png" alt="Logo with name on white background" style="width: 200px;"></td>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E1M7c65.png" alt="Logo with name on blue background" style="width: 200px;"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

These new variants bring the necessary modernity and flexibility for the logo's use in various visual contexts, such as the website, social media posts, and display in store windows, while retaining a classic and sleek touch that reflects the agency's expertise and stability.
